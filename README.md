# RBE

An attempt to build a toy web browser engine using rust. Unfortunately the DNS lookup feature of rust is still unstable, so I have decided to stop developing until the feature is finished.

## Install and run
You need the latest [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org) installed.

You can run the application using `cargo run` which will pull in all dependencies for you.
Another option is running `cargo build` which will create an executable file

## Ideas and Contributions
are welcome, but the development of this has been stopped at the moment :broken_heart:
